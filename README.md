# spatial-mixer
Spatial mixer based on 'Nearness'

See the schematic for suggested resistor values (borrowed direcly from Nearness)

# customisation

You can change the resistors to taste if required;
The resistor pairs for each input are marked on the silkscreen as follows:


HL = hard left

LL = mostly left

L = slightly left

HP = centered, with high pass filter

C = centered

R = slightly right

RR = mostly right

HR = hard right


The '+' and '-' symbols indicate which resistor should be bigger (+) and smaller (-) in value

Eg. HL+ is 1M67 ohm, HL- is 100k ohm

The resistors for HP and C should all be the same, to keep the signal centered.

# 3.5mm jacks

The left output should be a stereo (green) Thonkiconn. The right output should be a mono (black) Thonkiconn.
